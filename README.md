    <br><br>Small fix for lamps:
    <br>`// updating lamps eye space position`
		<br>`for (int i = 0; i<lamps.length; i++) lamps[i].calculateLampPosInEyeSpace(mViewMatrix);`
    <br>Add this to `display` method
    <br>This is necessary to add in the event that on your scene the lamps do not move, but the camera moves
